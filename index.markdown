Hi, I'm Quanquan Hu (Chinese: 胡泉泉), a 2nd year graduate student from [Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.shao.cas.cn/) (SHAO).

My interests are in the field of exoplanets, especially in the detection and characterization of exoplanets using transit method.

I'm currently working on high proformance computing (HPC) on exoplanet transit modeling and detection under the supervision of [Dr. Jian Ge](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xrAGwa0AAAAJ).

If you are interested in my research or project, please feel free to contact me via email: huquanquan@shao.ac.cn.
